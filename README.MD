for help!

Here is the Crack of the Mon Bazou Loader.

Pretty easy and useless codechanges that allows you to load all the official mods without owning the game on steam.

I only cracked those retards dog code because they think they are clever with their "anti-piracy" code

Enjoy. You can download the finished .exe release by pressing download on the ModManagerUpdate.zip or if u are skeptical and think i will rat u with my code
you can download the source with the source.zip and build your own .exe with a .net compiler.

Enjoy it i dont know if i will bring out any updates to the loader itself bc it is retarded but the mod list will auto-update so no worries.

Only tested on the newest version of the game and it works fine. If you have any questions than fuck yourself i wont give support. Maybe under the YouTube Video.

```diff
- If there is any retarded Error you can go on the official Mon Bazou Discord and look at the flowchart
- but dont write in the mod support channel or you will be banned
- for using a pirated copy of the game. If they are any bugs go and complain at their retarded
- Developer Amenofisch bc his code is dogshit and i wont be bothered to fix
- his shit.
```
And Santa Goat if you are reading this that stop developing this dogshit pile of spaghetti code Loader and publish your mods on nexusmods or something like that because it is so painful and cringe to see your mods and devs "hunting" for pirated copies. I get it, you dont want your game to be pirated and i bought it myself because it is pretty great but Amenofish clearly dosent know what he is doing and the mod loader drama is just cringe. There are many false postives. You cannot stop people from pirating your game because it is steam.
