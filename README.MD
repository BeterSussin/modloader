Here is the Crack of the Mon Bazou Loader.

Pretty easy and useless codechanges that allows you to load all the official mods without owning the game on steam.

I only cracked those retards dog code because they think they are clever with their "anti-piracy" code

Enjoy. You can download the finished .exe release by pressing download on the ModManagerUpdate.zip or if u are skeptical and think i will rat u with my code
you can download the source with the source.zip and build your own .exe with a .net compiler.

Enjoy it i dont know if i will bring out any updates to the loader itself bc it is retarded but the mod list will auto-update so no worries.

Only tested on the newest version of the game and it works fine. If you have any questions than fuck yourself i wont give support. Maybe under the YouTube Video.

```diff
- If there is any retarded Error you can go on the official Mon Bazou Discord and look at the flowchart
- but dont write in the mod support channel or you will be banned
- for using a pirated copy of the game. If they are any bugs go and complain at their retarded
- Developer Amenofisch bc his code is dogshit and i wont be bothered to fix
- his shit.
